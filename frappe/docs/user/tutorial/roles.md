# Creating Roles

Before creating Models, we must create Roles so that we can set permissions on the Model. There are two Roles we will create:

1. Librarian
1. Library Member

To create a new Role, go to:

> Core > Documents > Role > New

<img class="screenshot" alt="Adding Roles" src="{{url_prefix}}/assets/img/roles_creation.png">

{next}
